# Welcome to your translation app ðŸ‘‹

This is a serverless React Native (Expo)-based translation app that uses the Gemini 2.0 experimental model with Google Cloud. It allows you to create universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web using JavaScript and React. It utilizes three APIs: the Generative Language API, Cloud Speech-to-Text API, and Cloud Text-to-Speech API. You can enable these APIs on Google Cloud.

## Features
- Speech-to-text transcription.
- Translate text to English, Japanese, and Chinese using Gemini 2.0 exp.
- Text-to-speech audio playback.

## Get started
